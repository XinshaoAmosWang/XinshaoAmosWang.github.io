Summary of research progress on Synthetic Biology powered by Deep Learning. <br />
{:.message}


## [Preliminaries About Synthetic Biology](../../Papers/)
* Glossaries: 
  * Protein
  * RNA (tRNA, mRNA, rRNA)
  * Gene
  * DNA
* Protein synthesis pipeline: DNA (including coding regions, a.k.a. genes, and non-coding regions) -> RNAs -> Proteins
* Orthogonal translation systems
* DNA assembly

## [Deep learning techniques](../../Papers/)
* Biological senses: Biological problems to solve, what factors need to be considered. 
  
* Data collection, curation, pre-analysis before modelling
  * active learning for informed training data building
  * human-in-the-loop data curation, cleaning, and model improvement
  
* DL models: 
  * transformers, 
  * perceivers, 
  * GNN, etc
  
* Adverse/Challenging cases/scenes/settings: 
  * meta-learning (small data for each separate task),
  * few-shot setting
  * NAS, 
  * label noise, 
  * sample imbalance, etc
  
* Model interpretation, analysis, and further improvement
  * Explainable or interpretive or transparent AI 
  * Uncertainty measurement and explanation
  
* General DL aspects: 
  * memory efficient
  * fast inference
  * optimisation techniques
  * loss functions
  * generalisation: avoid overfitting and underfitting
