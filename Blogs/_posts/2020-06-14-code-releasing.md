For source codes, the usage is conditioned on academic use only and kindness to cite our work: Derivative Manipulation and IMAE.<br />
As a young researcher, your interest and kind citation (star) will definitely mean a lot for me and my collaborators.<br />
For any specific discussion or potential future collaboration, please feel free to contact me. 

### When talking about robustness/regularisation, our community tend to connnect it merely to better test performance. I advocate caring training performance as well because: 
* If noisy training examples are fitted well, a model has learned something wrong;
* If clean ones are not fitted well,  a model is not good enough. 
* There is a potential arguement that the test dataset can be infinitely large theorectically, thus being significant. 
  * Personal comment: Though being true theorectically, in realistic deployment, we obtain more testing samples as time goes, accordingly we generally choose to retrain or fine-tune to make the system adaptive. Therefore, this arguement does not make much sense.
