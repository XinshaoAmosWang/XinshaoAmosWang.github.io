For source codes, the usage is conditioned on academic use only and kindness to cite our work: Derivative Manipulation and IMAE.<br />
As a young researcher, your interest and star (citation) will mean a lot for me and my collaborators.<br />
For any specific discussion or potential future collaboration, please feel free to contact me.
