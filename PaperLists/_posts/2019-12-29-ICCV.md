## Noisy Labels, ...
* [Deep Self-Learning From Noisy Labels](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Han_Deep_Self-Learning_From_Noisy_Labels_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf): The proposed SMP trains in an iterative manner which
contains two phases: the first phase is to train a network
with **the original noisy label and corrected label** generated
in the second phase.
* [Co-Mining: Deep Face Recognition With Noisy Labels](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Wang_Co-Mining_Deep_Face_Recognition_With_Noisy_Labels_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf): We propose a novel **co-mining** framework, which employs two peer networks to **detect the noisy faces,
exchanges the high-confidence clean faces and reweights the clean faces** in a mini-batch fashion.
* [NLNL: Negative Learning for Noisy Labels](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Kim_NLNL_Negative_Learning_for_Noisy_Labels_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf): Input image belongs to this label--Positive Learning; Negative Learning (NL)--CNNs are trained using a complementary label as in “input image does not belong to this complementary label.”
* [Symmetric Cross Entropy for Robust Learning With Noisy Labels](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Wang_Symmetric_Cross_Entropy_for_Robust_Learning_With_Noisy_Labels_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf): Already compared in our method. 
* [O2U-Net: A Simple Noisy Label Detection Approach for Deep Neural Networks](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Huang_O2U-Net_A_Simple_Noisy_Label_Detection_Approach_for_Deep_Neural_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf): It only requires adjusting the hyper-parameters of the deep network to make its status transfer from overfitting to underfitting (O2U) cyclically. The losses of each sample are recorded during iterations. The higher the normalized average loss of a sample, the higher the probability of being noisy labels.

Against Adversarial Attacks](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Wang_Bilateral_Adversarial_Training_Towards_Fast_Training_of_More_Robust_Models_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf)
