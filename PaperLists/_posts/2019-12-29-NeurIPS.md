## Example Weighting by Meta Learning for Robustness
* [Meta-Weight-Net: Learning an Explicit Mapping
For Sample Weighting](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8467-meta-weight-net-learning-an-explicit-mapping-for-sample-weighting.pdf)
    * A following work of [https://xinshaoamoswang.github.io/paperlists/2018-12-30-ICML/#example-weighting-by-meta-learning-gradient-directions](http://127.0.0.1:4000/paperlists/2018-12-30-ICML/#example-weighting-by-meta-learning-gradient-directions)
    *  We propose to automatically learn an explicit loss-weight function, parameterized by an MLP from
data in a meta-learning manner. Due to the universal approximation capability of this weight net, it can finely fit a wide range of weighting functions including those used in conventional research.
    * The sample weights of those
samples better complying with the meta-data knowledge will be improved, while those violating such meta-knowledge will be suppressed.
