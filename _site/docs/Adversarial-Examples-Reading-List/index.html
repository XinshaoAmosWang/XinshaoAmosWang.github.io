  <p>A compilation of papers in adversarial examples that I have read or plan to read. The number of papers in this subfield can be overwhelming. I hope this list is helpful for anyone who is interested in entering the field or looking for a quick survey. The list is by no means exhaustive so any paper suggestion is very welcome. The order of the papers is arbitrary. Couple of notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<img class="emoji" title=":+1:" alt=":+1:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44d.png" height="20" width="20"> simply denotes papers that, solely based on my <strong>personal</strong> opinion, are influential to the way I think about adversarial examples.</li>
  <li>Some papers will have a short summary I wrote to remind myself what the paper is about + my personal thoughts/reactions. It is not a complete description of the paper.</li>
  <li>I recommend using <strong>TeX All the Things</strong> Chrome Extension for viewing math equations on this page.</li>
  <li>Do expect mistakes, misunderstanding, and shallow interpretation as I am an ignorant PhD student. Please correct me if you found one of those mistakes. I will really appreciate it.</li>
  <li>Enjoy!</li>

      <li>Through some analyses, the adversarial examples are found to be <strong>more similar</strong> to the guide sample than the original despite little change in pixel space. A number of experiments shows that the nature of this deep-representation adversarial examples is very different from that of the normal ones.

      <li>Very successful against adversarial training: the attack is far from the learned manifold, even for adversarial training. Interestingly, the affine transformation part does not affect clean accuracy at all. So the network generalizes to such transformation, but the transformation does put the starting sample in a <strong>more vulnerable</strong> region.</li>

  </li>
  <li>Chen and Vorobeychik, <strong>Regularized Ensembles and Transferability in Adversarial Learning</strong>, AAAI 2018.
    <ul>
      <li>Transferability seems to be blocked by 1) different last layer/loss (normal, SVM), 2) regularization norm ($\ell_1, \ell_2$), 3) regularization constant (5, 4.999999, 4.9999999). Choice of regularization constant is particularly interesting. Could tiny change in the loss function change the landscape of the optima?</li>
      <li>Attack with ensemble (average last layer): more sub-models increases attack success rate, redundant sub-models in the ensemble (sub-models not in the target) hurts success rate slightly, but after two extra models, adding more does not reduce success rate. This is likely due to the two type of regularizations used or potentially the choice of target network.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Shumailov et al., <strong>Sitatapatra: Blocking the Transfer of Adversarial Examples</strong>, 2019.
    <ul>
      <li>Each convolutional layer is extended with two components: Detector and Guard.
        <ul>
          <li>Detector: put each activation through element-wise polynomial (coefficients are randomized and kept secret). The model is trained to minimize this polynomial to be under some threshold $t$. Assumption is clean samples won’t trigger this threshold, but adversarial examples may.
            <ul>
              <li>Choice of coefficient affects transferability (more similar more transfer) e.g. $2x^2 + 3x + 5 &lt; t = 6$. But wouldn’t this just tries to make activation small? How does it help distinguish OOD? Why not use higher degree?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Guard: use some per-channel attention masking with randomized secret pre-determined coefficients. This is said to diversify the gradient and reduce transferability.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>They propose a simple scheme of adversarial training with multiple models: to summarize, the first model is trained on clean samples, and each of the subsequent models is trained on a union of clean samples and FGSM adversarial examples generated from all of the models before it.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Propose a defense against adversarial examples, classifying samples by finding distance to “class mean” in the representation layer. The class mean is not really a mean but a trainable weight that is trained as an auxiliary loss (pull: mean &amp; samples from same class. push: mean &amp; samples from diff class, mean &amp; mean from diff class) in addition to normal CE loss. Further improve robustness when combined with PGD/FGSM adversarial training.</li>
      <li>The results are however not convincing. This method should perform much worse than Madry et al. on MNIST at $\epsilon = 0.3$, but the paper omits this result. Results on CIFAR-10 are also not SOTA.</li>

  <li>Khoury and Hadfield-Menell, <strong>Adversarial Training with Voronoi Constraints</strong>, 2019.
    <ul>
      <li>Assuming the “low-dimensional manifold hypothesis” (data is $k$-dimensional manifold in $d$-dimensional space where $k \ll d$), they show that kNN is more robust to adversarial examples and is more data-efficient to do “adversarial training”</li>
      <li>“Nearest neighbor classifiers are naturally robust in high <strong>codimensions</strong> because the Voronoi cells are elongated in the directions normal to the manifold when data are dense”</li>
      <li>Theorem 2: Provide sampling condition on training data (there must exist a sample within $\delta$ distance from any point in manifold) such that an $\epsilon$-expansion of the data manifold is classified correctly by nearest neighbor or adversarial training.</li>
      <li>Theorem 3: The size of training data (under sampling condition from Theorem 2) for nearest neighbor is exponentially smaller in $k$ compared to adversarial training. This proof, however, assumes very simplified manifolds.</li>
      <li>Propose adversarial training with Voronoi cell constraint instead of a norm ball. The inner maximization problem is similar to that of Madry et al’s but constrains that the objective variable, $\hat{x}$, stays in the Voronoi cell of the original training sample $x$. To avoid projection step on Voronoi cell, they take gradient step on the loss function and check if the constraint is satisfied after every step. If not, the optimization terminates. To speed up, instead of checking against the entire training set, only $m$ nearest samples from each class are sought and checked per one training sample, and this needs to be computed only once per dataset.</li>
      <li>The proposed adversarial training is for neural networks and not nearest neighbor, and no theoretical justification is given for why this adversarial training is better. My take is that it tries to make the network have similar behavior to 1-NN. No need to set $\epsilon$ as it leaves that to property of the dataset. Experiments on MNIST show improve in robustness at large $\ell_\infty$-norm with minimal accuracy drop on clean data. On CIFAR-10, it performs similarly to Madry et al.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Use a classifier with a branch off one of the deep representations. The branch detects adversarial examples, and the entire network is trained end-to-end with adversarial training using FGSM (clean : adv = 1 : 1).</li>
      <li>The method works relatively well even against adaptive adversary (FGSM, BIM, DeepFool). There seems to be an optimal magnitude of perturbation. Too small or too large perturbation seem to be easily detected. Detectors trained for large perturbation (FGSM) also seem to not generalize well to adversarial examples with small perturbation. This potentially suggests that this previous adversarial training method is not robust as it fails to generalize. Bypassed by Carlini and Wagner 2017.</li>

  <li>Feinman et al., <strong>Detecting Adversarial Samples from Artifacts</strong>, 2017.
    <ul>
      <li>Use two metrics, kernel density estimation and uncertainty measure with dropout, to detect adversarial examples relying on a claim that adversarial examples lie outside of a learned manifold resulting in low density region and high uncertainty. Note that both measurements are calculated on a deep representation due to a claim that it is more well-behaved.</li>
      <li>Gal &amp; Ghahramani (2015): dropout is an approximate deep Gaussian process. So randomly picked distribution on dropout can potentially measure uncertainty of given samples.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Define robustness for output of neural networks (any layer) as a probabilistic mapping. Rough idea: given some norm-bounded perturbation, measure distance (Renyi divergence) on two random distributions mapped from a clean input and its perturbed version. Ball-bounded input -&gt; (Theorem 3) Renyi-robust after first layer -&gt; (Lemma 1 + Theorem 2) Renyi-div in output -&gt; (Theorem 1) Total Variation distance in output -&gt; certifiable robustness. Only consider noise added to activation after the first layer (same as Lecuyer et al.).</li>
      <li>“Renyi-robustness” depends on 4 parameters $\lambda, \alpha, \epsilon, \gamma$, defined over distribution of all samples. $\gamma$ is set to 0.</li>
      <li>Point out that robustness definition (bounded change in output) is disconnected from clean accuracy (i.e. you can have very robust classifier with useless accuracy). Regard noise injection during training as distribution shift problem from noise injection during inference.</li>
      <li>Evaluate with four distributions from Exponential family (Gaussian, Laplacian, Exponential, Weibull). Exponential seems to do best, but none helps against CW attack (perturbation is unbounded). Assuming one noise draw per sample since there’s no need to compute any probability (?). The results are not reported with $\epsilon$ or $\alpha$ so it is difficult to see how the accuracy drops. Clean acc. and $\ell_2$-PGD are very close for the given norm of 0.3.</li>

      <li>Introduce GroupSort (partition and sort) as an activation function for neural network that has its weight constrained by Lipschitz. They show that ReLU (or tanh) norm-constrained (1-Lipschitz) network cannot approximate universal Lipschitz function (e.g. absolute value, which is 1-Lipschitz). They show theoretically and empirically that GroupSort with unit spectral norm matrix can represent absolute value.</li>
      <li>They show that in training MNIST classifier with $K = 10$ GroupSort network utilizes “Lipschitz-ness” better (i.e. spectral norm of Jacobian at input $x$ is closer to $K$) than ReLU network.</li>
      <li>The weight normalization (spectral norm constraint) is done by Bjorck et al. for $\ell_2$ (equivalent to enforcing orthonormality) and by Condat for $\ell_\infty$ case. There is little difference in clean accuracy between ReLU and GroupSort network. Normal network with dropout tends to perform slightly better.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Gradient similarity defined between a pair of train and test samples, taken from influence function (Koh and Liang 2017), but the Hessian is omitted as they show that the Hessian only scales with constant. $GS(\hat{x},x’) = \nabla_\theta L(\hat{\theta}, x’, y’)^T \cdot \nabla_\theta L(\hat{\theta}, \hat{x}, \hat{y})$</li>
      <li>GS is separated into two features: $\ell_2$-norm of gradient and cosine of the angle between the two gradient terms. Logistic regression is trained on the features, half clean and half adversarial (FGSM, BIM, CW, DeepFool, JSMA). Works well against adversaries that have no knowledge of the defense, but fails in white-box setting.</li>

  <li>Kyatham et al., <strong>Variational Inference with Latent Space Quantization for Adversarial Robustness</strong>, 2019.
    <ul>
      <li>Train a VAE that uses mean squared error instead of log-likelihood for reconstruction and penalize norm of input-latent Jacobian to control Lipschitz constant. The latent space is also quantized “to prevent gradient-based attack.” This VAE is used to reconstruct any input sample before passing it to any (undefended) classifier.</li>
      <li>The main idea is constrained Lipschitz constant will “bound” change in the latent code given change in the input, and so by quantizing the latent space, the perturbation will be ignored by the decoder. There is some flaws, however. First, quantization helps against $\ell_\infty$-norm perturbation, but in the paper, spectral norm is used. This choice should be consistent but unfortunately is specific to adversary.</li>
      <li>The white-box attack experiments states that quantization “prevents attacks” but does not explain how the attack is carried out. The defense can be better evaluated by replacing the hard quantization with a soft one for gradient-based attack. Also, perturbation norm for CW or Deepfool is not reported. The defense is surprisingly most vulnerable to FGSM. The black-box attack uses transfer between different classifiers.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>It is not clear how reducing the adversarial subspace would provide adversarial robustness. In adversarial case, robustness depends only on the worst-case (closest) point that is misclassified. The method does not seem to affect the boundary so white-box robustness is questionable. It potentially could make adversarial examples harder to find and maybe reduce transferability.</li>

      <li>Experiment with some <strong>universal class-dependent</strong> directions in the input space, extending the works of Fawzi et al.: (1) use DeepFool to find boundary close to samples, (2) find Hessian of difference of loss of the correct class and all other classes, (3) find eigenvalues, eigenvectors of mean of Hessian.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Consider a simple model: input is $x_1, x_2, x_3$, network outputs $x_1 == x_2$. $x_3$ is thus “redundant” and all neurons connected to it should have weight of zero for the network to make no error, but this constraint on the weights grow exponentially on redundant input.</li>
      <li>“General model” has two components: erasing noise/unrelated features, and matching with known patterns. Adversarial attacks simply create patterns or enough redundancy that the model cannot completely erase.</li>
      <li>Hypothesis &amp; experiment: (1) Adversarial examples are more “complex”: (a) require larger networks to memorize/classify, (b) higher entropy (i.e. for MNIST, maximum likelihood, minimax, compression estimator). (2) More robust models learn features with less entropy.</li>

      <li>Adversarial training with on-manifold adversarial examples (i.e. searching in latent space of VAE-GAN) improves “generalization”: lower test error, lower on-manifold adv. success rate. Does not lower off-manifold adv. success rate.</li>

      <li>Try to show that adversarial examples are not a surprising phenomenon and can be expected from any well-behaved classifiers. The $\epsilon$-boundary measure, probability that $x$ is $\epsilon$ away from the error set, is large even if  the error set itself is small.</li>
      <li>They also show, on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, that training with different types of noises, especially Gaussian with large std, can moderately improve model’s robustness against adversarial examples (but less than adversarial training). However, an adversarially trained model is also more susceptible to Gaussian noise but still better than the undefended model.</li>
      <li>Defenses that exhibit gradient masking (does not create a larger distance to boundary) do not improve robustness to other types of noise. Encourage improvement in robustness to general noise, and say that perfect accuracy under noises is nontrivial.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Adversarial robustness depends heavily on some characteristic of dataset. Data can be transformed in such a way that its clean accuracy is unchanged, but robust accuracy can vary significantly. Hypothesis: loosely speaking, feature squeezing makes dataset “easier” to learn so adversarial training works better, hence the model becomes more robust.</li>
      <li>Saturated CIFAR-10 (similar to bit depth squeezing) seems be very robust when combined with adversarial training. Edge detection on FMNIST or adjusting gamma on CIFAR-10 seems to also affect robustness after adversarial training.</li>
      <li>Analysis on the phenomenon: (1) “perturbable volume”: binarization pushes data towards the edge of the allowed domain? Removing the [0, 1] constraint in the attack does not seem to have any effect, though in this case, the volumes inside and outside the training data manifold should be naturally different. (2) Inter-class distance: seems correlated, but there are lots of easy counterexamples. “Distance” here is $\ell_2$-based and seems arbitrary (top 10% nearest neighbors). (3) Model capacity and training set size have significant effects. Larger models are usually more robust but requires more data. More data reduces the generalization gap (between test and train robust accuracies) and the gap between clean and robust accuracies.</li>

      <li>Hypothesis 1: Adversarial examples on adversarially trained models lie closer to natural data manifold compared to undefended models. They show this using VAE-GAN and measure distance between input and its reconstruction. They also speculate that gradient of samples closer to clean data manifold is more interpretable.</li>
      <li>Hypothesis 2: Connection to tilting boundary theory. They show on 2D toy dataset that adversarial training aligns the decision boundary more perpendicular to high-variance direction (invariant to low-variance direction), and so they hypothesize that gradient required to cross the boundary aligns better with “human perception.”</li>
      <li>They test two attribution techniques (just gradient and gradient * input) and measure their interpretability score with two metrics (retain and retrain, keep and retrain). They show that strength of adversarial training correlates with higher interpretability scores.</li>

      <li>Theorem 10 (non-linear classifier, non-random augment): For $r \leq \epsilon$, there exists an $r$-ball augmented data set of size $d+1$ times the original, that increases margin for any classifier chosen from a set of $\epsilon$<strong>-respectful</strong> classifiers (see Definition 7).</li>
