## [NeurIPS 2019-Multi-relational Poincaré Graph Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.09791.pdf)
**NOTE**: 
Hyperbolic embeddings have recently gained attention in machine learning due to their ability to **represent hierarchical data more accurately and succinctly than their Euclidean analogues**. However, **multi-relational knowledge graphs often exhibit multiple simultaneous hierarchies, which current hyperbolic models do not capture.** To address this, we propose a model that embeds multi-relational graph data in the Poincaré ball model of hyperbolic space. Our Multi-Relational Poincaré model (MuRP) learns relation-specific parameters to transform entity embeddings by Möbius matrix-vector multiplication and Möbius addition. Experiments on the hierarchical WN18RR knowledge graph show that our multi-relational Poincaré embeddings outperform their Euclidean counterpart and existing embedding methods on the link prediction task, particularly at lower dimensionality.
