### ICCV 2019: Co-segmentation Inspired Attention Networks for Video-based Person Re-identification

 * Why: Video-based Re-ID approaches have gained significant attention recently since a video, and not just an image, is often available.

* We propose a novel Co-segmentation in-
    spired video Re-ID deep architecture and formulate a Co-
    segmentation based Attention Module (COSAM) that **activates a common set of salient features across multiple frames of a video via mutual consensus in an unsupervised manner.** 
    As opposed to most of the prior work, our approach is able to **attend to person accessories along with the person.** 
    Our plug-and-play and interpretable COSAM module applied on two deep architectures (ResNet50, SE-ResNet50) outperform the state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark
    datasets
